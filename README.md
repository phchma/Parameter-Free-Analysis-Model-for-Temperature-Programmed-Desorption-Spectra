# Parameter-Free-Analysis-Model-for-Temperature-Programmed-Desorption-Spectra
Matlab codes for estiblishing analysis model for Temperature Programmed Desorption(TPD) spectra

We would like to share our Matlab codes for analysing either single-peak or multi-peak TPD spectra.
There are two files, 
  'Single-Peak TPD' file demonstrates how to produce some artifical TPD spectra, and how to apply the proposed model for analysing the spectra.
  'Multi-Peak TPD' file includes four steps for demonstrating how to apply the proposed model for analysing the two-peak TPD spectra.
  
For more applications, you can read our published work:
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.9b03867

You are free to modify and improve the model's codes in the future. 
Btw, please cite the above paper if you use the proposed model for analysing your own TPD data.
